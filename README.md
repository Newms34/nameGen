#nameGen

Name generator, exploring the possible permutations of different names. Also, heh, random Asura names.

##So, what is this?
It's a random (lore-friendly!) name generator for the 5 [GW2](http://www.guildwars2.com) races. 

## "0.39451035438105464" doesn't seem like a particularly lore-friendly human/sylvari name!
That's because it's not. Don't be a wiseguy. I haven't written that part yet.
