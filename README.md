# nameGen

Name generator, exploring the possible permutations of different names. Also, heh, random Asura names.

### So, what is this?
It's a random (lore-friendly!) name generator for the 5 [GW2](http://www.guildwars2.com) races. 

## What about different human 'areas'?
If you mean Canthan, Elonian, etc., I've yet to implement those. I'm having trouble locating a reliable source of north/mid-African names. As for Canthan, which potentially should use East Asian (usually, Chinese with some Japanese), the issue here is that most of the names given are NOT in Romaji/Pinyin. And of course, automatic pinyinizers are not reliable! So just Tyrian names for now. Sorry!
